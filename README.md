# RapidRAW

> A blazingly-fast, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.

RapidRAW is a feature-rich image manipulation program, similar to Adobe Lightroom, designed from the ground up for maximum performance. By leveraging a **Rust** backend with a **WGPU-based** processing pipeline and a modern **React** frontend inside a **Tauri** shell, it offers a responsive and efficient editing experience for photographers and enthusiasts. Thanks to Tauri, it's a lightweight, cross-platform application available for **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

This project was developed by me, [Timon KÃ¤ch](https://github.com/CyberTimon), as a personal challenge in just two weeks at the age of 18.

    <td valign="top" width="50%">
      <h4>Core Editing Engine</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GPU-Accelerated Processing:</strong> All image adjustments are processed on the GPU using a custom WGSL shader for real-time feedback.</li>

        <li><strong>Detail Enhancement:</strong> Sharpening, Clarity, Structure, and Noise Reduction (Luminance & Color).</li>
        <li><strong>Effects:</strong> Dehaze, Vignette, and realistic Film Grain simulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Transform Tools:</strong> Crop with aspect ratio locking, Rotate, and Flip.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
      <h4>Library & Workflow</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complete Image Library:</strong> Sort, rate, and manage your photos efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Folder Management:</strong> Integrated folder tree, create, rename, and delete folders directly within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>File Operations:</strong> Copy, move, and duplicate images and their associated edits.</li>
        <li><strong>Filmstrip View:</strong> Quickly navigate between images in your current folder while editing.</li>
        <li><strong>Batch Operations:</strong> Apply adjustments or export multiple images at once.</li>
        <li><strong>EXIF Data Viewer:</strong> Inspect your camera's metadata.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Productivity & UI</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preset System:</strong> Create, save, import, and export your favorite looks.</li>
        <li><strong>Copy & Paste Settings:</strong> Quickly transfer adjustments between images.</li>
        <li><strong>Undo/Redo History:</strong> A robust history system for every edit.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable UI:</strong> Resizable panels and multiple beautiful UI themes with smooth animations.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Exporting:</strong> Control file format (JPEG, PNG, TIFF), quality, and resizing options on export.</li>

## The Story

#### The Motivation
As a photography enthusiast, I often found existing software to be sluggish and resource-heavy on my machine. Born from the desire for a more responsive and streamlined photo editing experience, I set out to build my own. The goal was to create a tool that was not only fast but also helped me learn the intricate details of digital image processing and camera technology.

#### The Challenge
I gave myself a strict deadline of **two weeks** to go from an empty folder to a functional, feature-rich application. This personal challenge pushed me to learn quickly, make pragmatic decisions, and focus intensely on the core architecture and user experience.

#### The Process
The foundation is built on Rust for its safety and performance, and Tauri for its ability to create lightweight, cross-platform desktop apps with a web frontend. The entire image processing pipeline is offloaded to the GPU via WGPU and a custom WGSL shader, ensuring that even on complex edits with multiple masks, the UI remains fluid.

I am immensely grateful for Google's Gemini suite of AI models. As an 18-year-old without a formal background in advanced mathematics or image science, the AI Studio's free tier was an invaluable assistant, helping me research and implement complex concepts like the Menon demosaicing algorithm.
